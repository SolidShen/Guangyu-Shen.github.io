About Me
======

My name is Guangyu Shen. I am currently a first year Ph.D student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). My research interests mainly lie at adversarial machine learning and backdoor attacks/defense for AI models. 

I am also a core member of team Perspecta-PurdueRutgers for [TrojAI competition](https://pages.nist.gov/trojai/). Our team ranks top cross round 1 to 4 and 6. Find more info [here](https://pages.nist.gov/trojai/docs/about.html).
